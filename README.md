- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew, a current Physics With Specialization in Astrophysics Student at UCSD!
- I'm currently working on various projects, such as my NASA-APOD program, primarily in Python.
- I primarily write programs designed to deal with simple data analysis or file parsing, but I also work on some more fun projects, such as my NASA-APOD program which I've been gradually evolving over the past few years.
